<b>   We'll begin with a box, and the prular is boxes,<br>
    But the plural of ox becomes oxen,not oxes.<br>
    One fowl  is a goose, but tw are called geese, <br>
    Yet theplural of moose should never be meese.<br>
    you may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
    Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.

    <u>If</u> the plural of man is always called men, <br>
    Why shouldn't the plural of pan be called  pen?<br>
    <u>If</u>  I speak of my foot and show youmy feet, <br>
    And i give you a boot, would a pair be caalled beet ? <br>
    <u>If</u>  one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
    Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth ?<br>

    The one may be that, and three would be those, <br>
    Yet hat in the plural would never be hose, <br>
    And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br>
    We speak of a brother and also of bretheren, <br>
    But though we say mother, we nevver say methren. <br>
    Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>
    <i><del>But imagine the feminime : she, shis, and shim !</del></i>
